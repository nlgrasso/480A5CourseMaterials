    "# 1.  Welcome! What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an **interpreted high level** programming language available and widely used throughout the world in a myriad of applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **interpreted high level** language is a type of programming language in which most of its implementations execute human-readable instructions directly, without the need for prior compilation into machine-language instructions. Here are some key points:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Execution*: Code is executed line-by-line by an interpreter.\n",
    "* *Abstraction*: Provides abstractions that hide the complexity of the hardware.\n",
    "* *Readability*: Syntax and semantics are closer to human languages, making it easier to understand and write.\n",
    "* *Portability*: Interpreted languages are generally more portable across different platforms.\n",
    "* *Development*: Easier to test and debug since you can run code immediately without a separate compilation step.\n",
    "* *Productivity*: Enhances programmer productivity by providing powerful constructs and libraries.\n",
    "* *Performance*: Typically slower than compiled languages because the interpreter translates code on the fly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of interpretable, high level languages are Python, JavaScript, Julia, Ruby. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is ubiquitous in the sciences and data sciences and is particularly popular in machine learning applications. It's open source, free, highly modular, and highly readable. Like other high-level programming languages, Python trades computational efficiency for readability but suits our main goal to introduce relevant concepts for quantitative biology without getting too bogged down in the coding details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to being open source, Python has a massive ecosystem of libraries and functionality at its disposal. In this class, we will introduce and use a number of those libraries for numerical methods, statistical analyses, image processing pipelines, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are _a huge number_ of excellent tutorials that introduce Python on Youtube. While we cover everything you will need to know for the course in this and subsequent notebooks, we highly recommend watching a few videos to get a feel for Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Official Python information can be found here:\n",

    "The course will occasionally refer to the book \"A student's guide to Python for physical modeling, 2nd Edition\" by Jesse M. Kinder and Philip Nelson. We highly recommend this book. It ill be a great resource for you when you get stuck, and we will refer to some sections in this book across our notebooks.\n",

    "grouping_option ::=  \"_\" | \",\" ::= group with spaces or commas, like 1,000,000\n",

    "#### An aside about iterator objects (zip)\n",
    "\n",
    "Any object that has a ```.__iter__()``` and ```.next()``` method is considered an **iterator**. To put it simply, these are objects that map a given bit of memory and return the desired values one at a time when iterated over. ```zip``` is an example of an iterator. If we call the zip object itself, it doesn't give us the list of tuples we expect, this is because the zip object hasn't been \"exhausted\" by being iterated over. The iterator object has to be called for its length to obtain all its values, hence why we have to convert it to a new list if we want to view it. Until it's exhausted it's effectively just a pointer to some location in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why does it do this? Well it's saving memory in the background! Calling zip on two objects logically means those objects are already in memory, to make a new object combining them means we are at least doubling the amount of memory right away, instead, zip makes a \"map\" of how to combine these two objects and only really MAKES the new object requested when it is used."
