    "The Spearman correlation test uses the Spearman correlation coefficient to measure the strength and direction between two ranked variables [1]. First, data needs to be ranked, with the highest value being assigned a 1 and the lowest value a 0. With the ranked values, the Spearman correlation coefficient is calculated with the following formula:\n",

    "\n",
    "From this formula, the Spearman correlation coefficient, r, can be between +1 and -1. +1 showcases a perfect association of ranks, and -1 showcases a perfect negative association of ranks. Spearman correlation test can evaluate the association of non-linear data and assesses monotonic relationships.\n",
