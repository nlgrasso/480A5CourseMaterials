    Performs the Harvey-Collier test for linearity in a linear regression model.

    Parameters:
    X : array-like, shape (n_samples, n_features)
        Predictor variables
    y : array-like, shape (n_samples,)
        Response variable

    Returns:

        p-value of the Harvey-Collier test.

    >>> p_value = harvey_collier(X, y)

    Notes:
    The Harvey-Collier Test checks whether a linear model is appropriately specified as linear.
    A small p-value indicates that the model may be misspecified, and should be used with a nonlinear model instead.
