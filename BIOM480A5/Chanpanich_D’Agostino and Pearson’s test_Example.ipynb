    "# D’Agostino and Pearson’s test\n",
    "D’Agostino and Pearson’s test is a statistical normality test that evaluates a dataset following a Gaussian distribution (normal shape). Unlike simpler normality tests, it can be used to examine both skewness and kurtosis, assessing deviation from normality. Skewness and kurtosis are statistical measures which describes different aspects of a data distribution's shape. Skewness value represents to the asymmetry of a distribution: zero (perfectly normal distribution), positive (longer tail on the right side), and negative (longer tail on the left side). Kurtosis can represent the tailedness and peak sharpness of a distribution: Mesokurtic (= 3, normal), Leptokurtic (> 3, heavy tails and sharp peak), and Platykurtic (< 3, light tails and flatter peak). Here are mathematical definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Skewness ($g_1$):**\n",
    "$$Skewness (g_1) = \\frac{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \\bar x)^3}{(\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \\bar x)^2)^{3/2}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Kurtosis ($g_2$) and Excess Kurtosis:**\n",
    "$$Kurtosis (g_2) = \\frac{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \\bar x)^4}{(\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \\bar x)^2)^2}$$\n",
    "$$Excess Kurtosis = Kurtosis (g_2) - 3$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transform Skewness and Kurtosis to Normal Variable ($Z_1$ and $Z_2$):**\n",
    "$$Z_1 = \\frac{\\sqrt{n(n-1)}}{n-2} . \\frac{g_1}{\\sqrt{6/n}}$$\n",
    "$$Z_2 = \\frac{g_2}{\\sqrt{24/n}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Compute Test Statistic ($K_2$):**\n",
    "$$K_2 = Z_1^2 + Z_2^2$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "**Compute the p-value:**\n",
    "$$p = P(χ_2^2 > K^2)$$\n",
    "A p-value is then calculated from the χ2 distribution. If the p-value is below a significance level (commonly 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the data are not normally distributed.\\\n",
    "Additionally, the below figure shows how the D'Agostino and Pearson's test evaluates the normality of data distributions by analyzing both skewness and kurtosis. The distribution of each dataset is evaluated, and the resulting p-values reveal whether the data significantly deviates from normality. Features marked in red indicate where the null hypothesis of normality is rejected, highlighting the test’s effectiveness in detecting non-normal distributions.\n",

    "**What situation might someone want to perform this test:** \\\n",
    "The D’Agostino and Pearson’s test is most useful when a researcher would like to determine a dataset follows a normal distribution. It contains some tests i.e. t-test, ANOVA, and linear regression. This test is particularly well-suited for moderate to large sample sizes. In biological research, it is useful for determining whether experimental measurements such as protein expression levels or fluorescence intensity, following a normal distribution before applying parametric statistical models. Additionally, the test early in the analyzation step can help to ensure the validity and reliability of subsequent inferences.\n",
